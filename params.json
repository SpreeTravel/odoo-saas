{"name":"Odoo SaaS","tagline":"Deploy SaaS solutions using Odoo with ease","body":"# Odoo SaaS\r\nWe use cutting edge technologies: *Docker*, *nGinx*, *Amazon Web Services* (*AWS*): *EC2*, *ELB*, *EBS* & *RDS*.\r\n \r\nThe technology we have developed is 100% Open Source and available at Github. The add­ons include SaaS solution management from a central Odoo, setting up and subscription to service plans.\r\n* Launches a tenant (Odoo instance) for each entity (person or company) subscribed to the SaaS. \r\n* Service plans management \r\n  + Listing of required and optional add­ons. \r\n  + Database maximum size. \r\n  + Additional services (support, data migration, etc). \r\n* Associate add­ons to a Plan. \r\n  + Required add­ons are included in the template database used to create each new tenant, so that they result pre­installed when a new account is created on the SaaS service.\r\n  + Required add­ons are the same in all tenants sharing a Plan. \r\n  + Optional add­ons appear on each tenant as available to be installed at will. \r\n  + From the central system managing the SaaS service a new required add­on can be included into a Plan and then perform a deployment action for that add­on to be included in all tenants created from the Plan. \r\n* Although the primary add­on management is performed in a Plan basis, from the central system specific actions can be executed for a particular tenant. \r\n* Create SaaS Client databases: \r\n  + manually from SaaS Portal backend \r\n  + by client after choosing subdomain (similar to ​https://www.odoo.com/page/start​­) via module `saas_portal_start`. \r\n  + by client after choosing database template (e.g. template for POS, template for ECommerce etc) with auto­generated subdomain (e.g. demo­12345.odoo.com) ­via module `saas_server_templates`.\r\n  + by client after signing up via­ module `saas_portal_signup`.\r\n\r\n* Prepare templates for new SaaS Client database. You are able to connect to template database, install modules you need, edit configuration, edit access rights for customer etc. Such template database will be exactly what a customer will see after database creating. \r\n* Connect to existing SaaS Client database as administrator. \r\n* Control SaaS Client database from SaaS Portal backend: \r\n  + install, update, delete add­ons.\r\n  + configure parameters (e.g. Max Allowed Users).\r\n* Collect information from client databases (number of users, disk space usage, etc.).\r\n* Notify customers about news by sending messages to Whole Company messaging group (under development).\r\n* Show message at the top of a page (e.g. Your free trial will expire in about 4 hours Register now to add 15 days for free!) (under development).\r\n* Ability for users to reset their own passwords (Forgot your password?).\r\n* Support for SSL with a digital certificate. \r\n* Ability to monitor the databases system wise.\r\n* Ability to send automatic invoices every month.\r\n* Remove the default Odoo logo and name in the server. \r\n* Automatic Backup of the databases. \r\n* Restoration of the backed up databases. \r\n* Payment gateway integration. \r\n* SaaS Administration with SaaS Panel.\r\n* SaaS Panel Administration with Activate/ Deactivate/ Terminate options for Tenant Database.\r\n* SaaS Tenant Technical Support option with Pseudo Admin.\r\n\r\n## All you need to deploy Odoo (former OpenERP) SaaS.\r\nThe present document provides an overview on how to easily deploy SaaS solutions with Odoo (formerly known as OpenERP).\r\n\r\n### Odoo addons to provide SaaS\r\n\r\nOur solution makes use of IT-Projects LLC's [Odoo SaaS Tools](https://github.com/yelizariev/odoo-saas-tools) which provides the following SaaS structure:\r\n\r\n* *SaaS Portal* (one): main database\r\n* *SaaS Server* (many): technical database to control client databases. SaaS server creates, edits and deletes databases. Each SaaS Server can be installed on a separate machine (e.g. VPS).\r\n* *SaaS Client* (many): client database to be used by customers. Each SaaS Client is attached to a SaaS Server.\r\n\r\n### Docker Image to provide Odoo SaaS solutions\r\n\r\nWe have created a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image for our solution, you can find it pulling `cenitsaas/cenitodoo` from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cenitsaas/cenitodoo).\r\n\r\n#### Database Setup\r\nIn order to have the image connect to a PostgreSQL database you have a couple of options available:\r\n\r\n1. You could use the traditional linking to a PostgreSQL container in the same manner the official Docker image for Odoo does.\r\n2. You could set up a custom PostgreSQL server through the environment variables\r\n  * `PGHOST`: the hostname of the system where the PostgreSQL server is running.\r\n  * `PGPORT`: the system port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening (defaults to `5432` if omitted).\r\n  * `PGUSER`: the username to use when connecting to the PostgreSQL server.\r\n  * `PGPASSWORD`: the password for the provided user.\r\n3. If deploying the image on Amazon Web Services' Elastic Beanstalk, you could choose to launch a new RDS instance and the image will figure out how to connect to it.\r\n\r\n#### SaaS setup\r\nThere are a few environment variables that you'll have to take into consideration while deploying the image.\r\n\r\n##### Mandatory\r\n* `MAIN_DOMAIN`: identifies the *SaaS Portal*. Commonly it is a first level domain name (e.g: `example.com`).\r\n* `SERVER_SUBDOMAIN`: identifies the first *SaaS Server*. Common a direct subdomain of `MAIN_DOMAIN` (e.g: `server1.example.com`)\r\n\r\n##### Optional\r\n* `CUSTOM_REPOS`: a comma-separated list of (currently) public Git repositories containing Odoo addons that should be available on the solution (e.g: `https://github.com/me/myrepo.git,https://github.com/him/hisrepo.git`).\r\n\r\n### Configurations needed to deploy the Odoo SaaS Docker image on Amazon Web Services\r\nAmazon Web Services include a handful of services that provide everything you may need to deploy Odoo SaaS.\r\n\r\n#### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\r\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity—literally, servers in Amazon's data centers—that can be used to build and host software systems.\r\n\r\n#### Relational Database Service (RDS)\r\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.\r\n\r\n#### Elastic Beanstalk (EBS)\r\nAmazon Elastic Beanstalk (Amazon EBS) allows to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. Simply upload the application and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\r\n\r\n#### Deploying `cenitsaas/cenitodoo` with EBS\r\n\r\n### Pointing a GoDaddy Domain Name to a newly deployed Odoo SaaS\r\nThe one issue with this approach is that since Amazon’s Load Balancers don’t get an Elastic IP address (this means that its IP address will change if the Load Balancer is rebooted) the main domain won’t be possible to point at the Load Balancer since it must be done with an A Record (a direct association from the domain name to an IP address). Instead, we will be creating a CNAME rule (an alias) for all subdomains to be redirected to the load balancer. \r\n\r\n1. Sign in to your GoDaddy.com account ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6KrzJzSiyCrd1dDFJlddxQkNkmPrP2LOfFKx6ncPtDtt_axTqWWvKHhVo2uJaEgnd4FBoJDI6oM7vhFJHgw6Wpj4xRz5dISOJcrOFavZ73Sde1qe4jID05WHkdPCTzKT=s1600)\r\n2. Under *Domains* select manage ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BL5QYEuPFbQxatQi4A-R_yHquY6l4GrcFaVLSNqW-IUuMM_5jsAa5LFeTC_7Tdcax1_1qPxZwsDmquelKJ6akj0KKKM9sDmJkcXClhlZrmWgY8VY3zQvkNWAx-fmFzqA1A=s1600)\r\n3. Select the domain you want to point at the load balancer ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V0FcqSR4Z5VNrxpOnN-RsaGoRALd0aSirO_F6wNoE8MM4iYFEdvaaNKIvfFnFRqEsUzzX43sMTuiPm-QH-JyLgDHxt15-RB9YRimyAlCnB2Fyu7I_BVTFfJhgD6b3wMO9Q=s1600)\r\n4.

Add a record ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X7wgVuQdtcw6SUuApDW64vo3oRdnstPjMcdumvVDa3vB3wX4Uhilv0S54mQiOJA2O9xM8P207IRtU2GJCzhzYV3G1dCgAudh9oYOf8jNQ-5I9jNI7BGyjLlnG1MoBphrtQ=s1600)\r\n6. On the record type select CNAME (Alias) ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FVDTvPbktsyHn84ULMiDHW_P9z-PfnA2NFVvAkO-6F3oQdPWGYORy4CkNGB-PMU2fU3ymu6TDATvq3d5vCXwmS4SLpamNURbnW8ZxuV7HQK7h4PvbV1Gl8avqlZ_GqYz9A=s1600)\r\n7. For the Host type '*', this means all subdomains of the Domain Name, and in the Point To, type the alias of the load balancer generated by EBS ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Oe-tMGooRbwRJnLnvuwvisrxpNqDWsVnsflABoIiGnNHBdyEf0GqhBXn9TuZw7vRf3fsGkeHv-cbU5zacx0DYTFl-aTU_qpzthM3mF7QnjctVtk-8iOaIpDI4xjGL53m2w=s1600)\r\n8.
