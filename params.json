SaaS server creates, edits and deletes databases. Each SaaS Server can be installed on a separate machine (e.g. VPS).\r\n* *SaaS Client* (many): client database to be used by customers. Each SaaS Client is attached to a SaaS Server.\r\n\r\n### Docker Image to provide Odoo SaaS solutions\r\n\r\nWe have created a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image for our solution, you can find it pulling `cenitsaas/cenitodoo` from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cenitsaas/cenitodoo).\r\n\r\n#### Database Setup\r\nIn order to have the image connect to a PostgreSQL database you have a couple of options available:\r\n\r\n1. You could use the traditional linking to a PostgreSQL container in the same manner the official Docker image for Odoo does.\r\n2. You could set up a custom PostgreSQL server through the environment variables\r\n  * `PGHOST`: the hostname of the system where the PostgreSQL server is running.\r\n  * `PGPORT`: the system port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening (defaults to `5432` if omitted).\r\n  * `PGUSER`: the username to use when connecting to the PostgreSQL server.\r\n  * `PGPASSWORD`: the password for the provided user.\r\n3. If deploying the image on Amazon Web Services' Elastic Beanstalk, you could choose to launch a new RDS instance and the image will figure out how to connect to it.\r\n\r\n#### SaaS setup\r\nThere are a few environment variables that you'll have to take into consideration while deploying the image.\r\n\r\n##### Mandatory\r\n* `MAIN_DOMAIN`: identifies the *SaaS Portal*. Commonly it is a first level domain name (e.g: `example.com`).\r\n* `SERVER_SUBDOMAIN`: identifies the first *SaaS Server*. Common a direct subdomain of `MAIN_DOMAIN` (e.g: `server1.example.com`)\r\n\r\n##### Optional\r\n* `CUSTOM_REPOS`: a comma-separated list of (currently) public Git repositories containing Odoo addons that should be available on the solution (e.g: `https://github.com/me/myrepo.git,https://github.com/him/hisrepo.git`).\r\n\r\n### Configurations needed to deploy the Odoo SaaS Docker image on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk webservice\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nFor more details contact us at [support at cenitsaas dot com](mailto:support@cenitsaas.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
