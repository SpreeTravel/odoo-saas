SaaS server creates, edits and deletes databases. Each SaaS Server can be installed on a separate machine (e.g. VPS).\r\n* *SaaS Client* (many): client database to be used by customers. Each SaaS Client is attached to a SaaS Server.\r\n\r\n### Docker Image to provide Odoo SaaS solutions\r\n\r\nWe have created a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image for our solution, you can find it pulling `cenitsaas/cenitodoo` from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cenitsaas/cenitodoo).\r\n\r\n#### Database Setup\r\nIn order to have the image connect to a PostgreSQL database you have a couple of options available:\r\n\r\n1. You could use the traditional linking to a PostgreSQL container in the same manner the official Docker image for Odoo does.\r\n2. You could set up a custom PostgreSQL server through the environment variables\r\n  * `PGHOST`: the hostname of the system where the PostgreSQL server is running.\r\n  * `PGPORT`: the system port on which the PostgreSQL server is listening (defaults to `5432` if omitted).\r\n  * `PGUSER`: the username to use when connecting to the PostgreSQL server.\r\n  * `PGPASSWORD`: the password for the provided user.\r\n3. If deploying the image on Amazon Web Services' Elastic Beanstalk, you could choose to launch a new RDS instance and the image will figure out how to connect to it.\r\n\r\n#### SaaS setup\r\nThere are a few environment variables that you'll have to take into consideration while deploying the image.\r\n\r\n##### Mandatory\r\n* `MAIN_DOMAIN`: identifies the *SaaS Portal*. Commonly it is a first level domain name (e.g: `example.com`).\r\n* `SERVER_SUBDOMAIN`: identifies the first *SaaS Server*. Common a direct subdomain of `MAIN_DOMAIN` (e.g: `server1.example.com`)\r\n\r\n##### Optional\r\n* `CUSTOM_REPOS`: a comma-separated list of (currently) public Git repositories containing Odoo addons that should be available on the solution (e.g: `https://github.com/me/myrepo.git,https://github.com/him/hisrepo.git`).\r\n\r\n### Configurations needed to deploy the Odoo SaaS Docker image on Amazon Web Services\r\nAmazon Web Services include a handful of services that provide everything you may need to deploy Odoo SaaS.\r\n\r\n#### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\r\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable computing capacity—literally, servers in Amazon's data centers—that can be used to build and host software systems.\r\n\r\n#### Relational Database Service (RDS)\r\nAmazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.\r\n\r\n#### Elastic Beanstalk (EBS)\r\nAmazon Elastic Beanstalk (Amazon EBS) allows to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. Simply upload the application and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\r\n\r\n#### Deploying `cenitsaas/cenitodoo` with EBS\r\n\r\n### Pointing a GoDaddy Domain Name to a newly deployed Odoo SaaS\r\nThe one issue with this approach is that since Amazon’s Load Balancers don’t get an Elastic IP address (this means that its IP address will change if the Load Balancer is rebooted) the main domain won’t be possible to point at the Load Balancer since it must be done with an A Record (a direct association from the domain name to an IP address). Instead, we will be creating a CNAME rule (an alias) for all subdomains to be redirected to the load balancer. \r\n\r\n1. Sign in to your GoDaddy.com account ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6KrzJzSiyCrd1dDFJlddxQkNkmPrP2LOfFKx6ncPtDtt_axTqWWvKHhVo2uJaEgnd4FBoJDI6oM7vhFJHgw6Wpj4xRz5dISOJcrOFavZ73Sde1qe4jID05WHkdPCTzKT=s1600)\r\n2. Under *Domains* select manage ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BL5QYEuPFbQxatQi4A-R_yHquY6l4GrcFaVLSNqW-IUuMM_5jsAa5LFeTC_7Tdcax1_1qPxZwsDmquelKJ6akj0KKKM9sDmJkcXClhlZrmWgY8VY3zQvkNWAx-fmFzqA1A=s1600)\r\n3. Select the domain you want to point at the load balancer ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/V0FcqSR4Z5VNrxpOnN-RsaGoRALd0aSirO_F6wNoE8MM4iYFEdvaaNKIvfFnFRqEsUzzX43sMTuiPm-QH-JyLgDHxt15-RB9YRimyAlCnB2Fyu7I_BVTFfJhgD6b3wMO9Q=s1600)\r\n4. Go to the DNS Zone File ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vsZUY6IYl3HRgnXb9pilgnHmcdK0OVbsnMNy0vrtgX-21Vq2wI-rl9Pb3xhciVY0AkENLsbtFNOFh8zkGy1cF2TJbd7B3nscIj9K20XKPYG_C_edlo_xE0xgOaG-dV1r7w=s1600)\r\n5. Add a record ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X7wgVuQdtcw6SUuApDW64vo3oRdnstPjMcdumvVDa3vB3wX4Uhilv0S54mQiOJA2O9xM8P207IRtU2GJCzhzYV3G1dCgAudh9oYOf8jNQ-5I9jNI7BGyjLlnG1MoBphrtQ=s1600)\r\n6. On the record type select CNAME (Alias) ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FVDTvPbktsyHn84ULMiDHW_P9z-PfnA2NFVvAkO-6F3oQdPWGYORy4CkNGB-PMU2fU3ymu6TDATvq3d5vCXwmS4SLpamNURbnW8ZxuV7HQK7h4PvbV1Gl8avqlZ_GqYz9A=s1600)\r\n7. For the Host type '*', this means all subdomains of the Domain Name, and in the Point To, type the alias of the load balancer generated by EBS ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Oe-tMGooRbwRJnLnvuwvisrxpNqDWsVnsflABoIiGnNHBdyEf0GqhBXn9TuZw7vRf3fsGkeHv-cbU5zacx0DYTFl-aTU_qpzthM3mF7QnjctVtk-8iOaIpDI4xjGL53m2w=s1600)\r\n8.
